# Abstract

We study how to apply large language models to write grounded and organized long-form articles from scratch, with comparable breadth and depth to Wikipedia pages. This underexplored problem poses new challenges at the *pre-writing* stage, including how to research the topic and prepare an outline prior to writing. We propose STORM, a writing system for the Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking. STORM models the pre-writing stage by (1) discovering diverse perspectives in researching the given topic, (2) simulating conversations where writers carrying different perspectives pose questions to a topic expert grounded on trusted Internet sources, (3) curating the collected information to create an outline.

For evaluation, we curate FreshWiki, a dataset of recent high-quality Wikipedia articles, and formulate outline assessments to evaluate the pre-writing stage. We further gather feedback from experienced Wikipedia editors. Compared to articles generated by an outlinedriven retrieval-augmented baseline, more of STORM's articles are deemed to be organized (by a 25% absolute increase) and broad in coverage (by 10%). The expert feedback also helps identify new challenges for generating grounded long articles, such as source bias transfer and over-association of unrelated facts.

# 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive writing capabilities [\(Yang et al.,](#page-12-0) [2023;](#page-12-0) [Pavlik,](#page-10-0) [2023;](#page-10-0) [Wenzlaff and Spaeth,](#page-11-0) [2022;](#page-11-0) [Fitria,](#page-9-0) [2023\)](#page-9-0), but it is unclear how we can use them to write grounded, long-form articles, like full-length Wikipedia pages. Such expository writing, which seeks to inform the reader on a topic in an organized manner [\(Weaver III and Kintsch,](#page-11-1) [1991;](#page-11-1) [Balepur et al.,](#page-9-1) [2023\)](#page-9-1), requires thorough research and planning in the *pre-writing* stage [\(Rohman,](#page-11-2)

<span id="page-0-0"></span>![](_page_0_Picture_10.jpeg)

Figure 1: We explore writing Wikipedia-like articles from scratch, which demands a pre-writing stage before producing the article. In this stage, simpler approaches like Direct Prompting have limited planning capacity. In contrast, STORM researches the topic via perspectiveguided question asking in simulated conversations.

[1965\)](#page-11-2), even before the actual writing process can start. However, prior work on generating Wikipedia articles [\(Banerjee and Mitra,](#page-9-2) [2015;](#page-9-2) [Minguillón](#page-10-1) [et al.,](#page-10-1) [2017;](#page-10-1) [Liu et al.,](#page-10-2) [2018;](#page-10-2) [Fan and Gardent,](#page-9-3) [2022\)](#page-9-3) has generally bypassed the pre-writing stage: for instance, [Liu et al.](#page-10-2) [\(2018\)](#page-10-2) presume reference documents are provided in advance, while [Fan and](#page-9-3) [Gardent](#page-9-3) [\(2022\)](#page-9-3) assume an article outline is available and focus on expanding each section. These assumptions do not hold in general, as collecting references and crafting outlines demand advanced information literacy skills [\(Doyle,](#page-9-4) [1994\)](#page-9-4) to identify, evaluate, and organize external sources - a task that is challenging even for experienced writers. Automating this process can facilitate individuals in initiating in-depth learning about a topic and greatly reduce the expensive expert hours necessary for their expository writing.

We explore these challenges by focusing on how to generate Wikipedia-like articles *from scratch*. We decompose this problem into two tasks. The first is to conduct research to generate an outline, *i.e.*, a list of multi-level sections, and collect a set of reference documents. The second uses the outline and the references to produce the full-length article. Such a task decomposition mirrors the human writing process which usually includes phases of pre-writing, drafting, and revising [\(Rohman,](#page-11-2) [1965;](#page-11-2) [Munoz-Luna,](#page-10-3) [2015\)](#page-10-3).

As pre-trained language models inherently possess a wealth of knowledge, a direct approach is to rely on their parametric knowledge for generating outlines or even entire articles (*Direct Gen*). However, this approach is limited by a lack of details and hallucinations [\(Xu et al.,](#page-11-3) [2023\)](#page-11-3), particularly in addressing long-tail topics [\(Kandpal et al.,](#page-10-4) [2023\)](#page-10-4). This underscores the importance of leveraging external sources, and current strategies often involve retrieval-augmented generation (*RAG*), which circles back to the problem of researching the topic in the pre-writing stage, as much information cannot be surfaced through simple topic searches.

Human learning theories [\(Tawfik et al.,](#page-11-4) [2020;](#page-11-4) [Booth et al.,](#page-9-5) [2003\)](#page-9-5) highlight *asking effective questions* in information acquisition. Although instruction-tuned models [\(Ouyang et al.,](#page-10-5) [2022\)](#page-10-5) can be prompted directly to generate questions, we find that they typically produce basic "What", "When", and "Where" questions (Figure [1](#page-0-0) (A)) which often only address surface-level facts about the topic. To endow LLMs with the capacity to conduct better research, we propose the STORM paradigm for the Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking.

The design of STORM is based on two hypotheses: (1) diverse perspectives lead to varied questions; (2) formulating in-depth questions requires iterative research. Building upon these hypotheses, STORM employs a novel multi-stage approach. It first discovers diverse perspectives by retrieving and analyzing Wikipedia articles from similar topics and then personifies the LLM with specific perspectives for question asking (Figure [1](#page-0-0) (B)). Next, to elicit follow-up questions for iterative research

(Figure [1](#page-0-0) (C)), STORM simulates multi-turn conversations where the answers to the generated questions are grounded on the Internet. Finally, based on the LLM's internal knowledge and the collected information, STORM creates an outline that can be expanded section by section to develop a fulllength Wikipedia-like article.

We evaluate STORM using our FreshWiki dataset ([§2.1\)](#page-2-0) which curates recent, high-quality Wikipedia articles to avoid data leakage during pretraining.[1](#page-1-0) To facilitate the study of the pre-writing stage, we define metrics for evaluating the outline quality against human-written articles.

We further invited a group of experienced Wikipedia editors for expert evaluation. The editors found STORM outperforms an outline-driven RAG baseline, especially regarding the breadth and organization of the articles. They also identified challenges for future research, including addressing cases where: (1) the bias on the Internet affects the generated articles; (2) LLMs fabricate connections between unrelated facts. These challenges present new frontiers to grounded writing systems.

Our main contributions include:

- To evaluate the capacity of LLM systems at generating long-form grounded articles from scratch, and the pre-writing challenge in particular, we curate the FreshWiki dataset and establish evaluation criteria for both outline and final article quality.
- We propose STORM, a novel system that automates the pre-writing stage. STORM researches the topic and creates an outline by using LLMs to ask incisive questions and retrieving trusted information from the Internet.
- Both automatic and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Expert feedback further reveals new challenges in generating grounded long-form articles.

# 2 FreshWiki

We study generating Wikipedia-like articles from scratch, placing emphasis on the *pre-writing* stage [\(Rohman,](#page-11-2) [1965\)](#page-11-2), which involves the demanding sub-tasks of gathering and curating relevant information ("research"). This models the human

writing approach which has prompted some educators to view Wikipedia article writing as an educational exercise for academic training [\(Tardy,](#page-11-7) [2010\)](#page-11-7).

Table [1](#page-2-1) compares our work against prior benchmarks for Wikipedia generation. Existing work has generally focused on evaluating the generation of shorter snippets (*e.g.*, one paragraph), within a narrower scope (*e.g.*, a specific domain or two), or when an explicit outline or reference documents are supplied. A notable example is WikiSum [\(Liu](#page-10-2) [et al.,](#page-10-2) [2018\)](#page-10-2), which treats generating Wikipedia articles as a multi-document summarization problem, with respect to the reference documents.

Our setup emphasizes the capability of longform grounded writing systems to research and curate content. Specifically, given a topic t, the task is to find a set of references R and generate a full-length article S = s1s2...sn, where each sentence s<sup>i</sup> cites a list of documents in R. [2](#page-2-2)

#### <span id="page-2-0"></span>2.1 The FreshWiki Dataset

Creating a new Wikipedia-like article demands not only fluent writing but also good research skills. As modern LLMs are generally trained on Wikipedia text, we mitigate data leakage by explicitly seeking out *recent* Wikipedia articles that were created (or very heavily edited) after the training cutoff of the LLMs we test. Our process can be repeated at future dates when new LLMs emerge.

To apply our date criteria, we focus on the top 100 most-edited pages, based on edit counts, for each month from February 2022 to September 2023[3](#page-2-3) . To ensure high-quality references, we filter these articles to keep only those having B-class quality or above assessed by ORES[4](#page-2-4) . We also exclude list articles[5](#page-2-5) and articles that have no subsections. While high-quality Wikipedia articles usually contain structured data (*e.g.*, tables) and are multi-modal, we only consider the plain text component in constructing the dataset to simplify our task. More details of the dataset are in Appendix [A.](#page-13-0)

#### <span id="page-2-7"></span>2.2 Outline Creation and Evaluation

A full-length article is hard to generate or evaluate [\(Xu et al.,](#page-11-3) [2023;](#page-11-3) [Krishna et al.,](#page-10-6) [2023\)](#page-10-6). When human educators teach students academic writing, they sometimes supervise students at the outline stage [\(Eriksson and Mäkitalo,](#page-9-6) [2015\)](#page-9-6) because an extensive outline indicates a comprehensive understanding of the topic and provides a solid foundation for writing the full-length article [\(Dietz and](#page-9-7) [Foley,](#page-9-7) [2019\)](#page-9-7). Inspired by this, we decompose the generation of S into two stages. In the pre-writing stage, we require the system to create an outline O, which is defined as a list of multi-level section headings[6](#page-2-6) . In the writing stage, the system uses the topic t, the references R, and an outline O to produce the full-length article S.

To evaluate the outline coverage, we introduce two metrics: *heading soft recall* and *heading entity recall*. These metrics compare the multi-level section headings of the human-written article, considered as ground truth, and those in O. Recognizing that an exact match between elements in these two sets of headings is unnecessary, we calculate the *heading soft recall* [\(Fränti and Mariescu-](#page-9-8)[Istodor,](#page-9-8) [2023\)](#page-9-8) using cosine similarity derived from Sentence-BERT [\(Reimers and Gurevych,](#page-11-8) [2019\)](#page-11-8) embeddings of the headings (details in Appendix [C.1\)](#page-13-1). We also compute the *heading entity recall* which is quantified as the percentage of named entities in human-written article headings covered by O. We extract entities with FLAIR named entity recognition (NER) [\(Akbik et al.,](#page-9-9) [2019\)](#page-9-9).

# <span id="page-2-8"></span>3 Method

We present STORM to automate the pre-writing stage by researching a given topic via effective question asking ([§3.1,](#page-3-0) [§3.2\)](#page-3-1) and creating an outline ([§3.3\)](#page-4-0). The outline will be extended to a fulllength article grounded on the collected references

<span id="page-2-2"></span><sup>2</sup> In practice, S also includes organizational elements such as section and subsection titles, which do not require citations.

Figure 2: The overview of STORM that automates the pre-writing stage. Starting with a given topic, STORM identifies various perspectives on covering the topic by surveying related Wikipedia articles ( 1 - 2 ). It then simulates conversations between a Wikipedia writer who asks questions guided by the given perspective and an expert grounded on trustworthy online sources ( 3 - 6 ). The final outline is curated based on the LLM's intrinsic knowledge and the gathered conversations from different perspectives ( 7 - 8 ).

([§3.4\)](#page-4-1). Figure [2](#page-3-2) gives an overview of STORM and we include the pseudo code in Appendix [B.](#page-13-2)

#### <span id="page-3-0"></span>3.1 Perspective-Guided Question Asking

[Rohman](#page-11-2) [\(1965\)](#page-11-2) defines pre-writing as the stage of discovery in the writing process. In parallel with stakeholder theory in business [\(Freeman et al.,](#page-9-10) [2010\)](#page-9-10), where diverse stakeholders prioritize varying facets of a company, individuals with distinct perspectives may concentrate on different aspects when researching the same topic and discover multifaceted information. Further, the specific perspectives can serve as prior knowledge, guiding individuals to ask more in-depth questions. For example, an event planner might ask about the "transportation arrangements" and "budget" for "the 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony", whereas a layperson might ask more general questions about the event's basic information (Figure [1](#page-0-0) (A)).

Given the input topic t, STORM discovers different perspectives by surveying existing articles from similar topics and uses these perspectives to control the question asking process. Specifically, STORM prompts an LLM to generate a list of related topics and subsequently extracts the tables of contents from their corresponding Wikipedia articles, if such articles can be obtained through Wikipedia API[7](#page-3-3) (Figure [2](#page-3-2) 1 ). These tables of contents are concatenated to create a context to prompt the LLM to identify N perspectives P = {p1, ..., p<sup>N</sup> } that

can collectively contribute to a comprehensive article on t (Figure [2](#page-3-2) 2 ). To ensure that the basic information about t is also covered, we add p<sup>0</sup> as "basic fact writer focusing on broadly covering the basic facts about the topic" into P. Each perspective p ∈ P will be utilized to guide the LLM in the process of question asking in parallel.

#### <span id="page-3-1"></span>3.2 Simulating Conversations

The theory of questions and question asking [\(Ram,](#page-11-9) [1991\)](#page-11-9) highlights that while answers to existing questions contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of a topic, they often simultaneously give rise to new questions. To kick off this dynamic process, STORM simulates a conversation between a Wikipedia writer and a topic expert. In the i-th round of the conversation, the LLM-powered Wikipedia writer generates a single question q<sup>i</sup> based on the topic t, its assigned perspective p ∈ P, and the conversation history {q1, a1, ..., qi−1, ai−1} where a<sup>j</sup> denotes the simulated expert's answer. The conversation history enables the LLM to update its understanding of the topic and ask follow-up questions. In practice, we limit the conversation to at most M rounds.

To ensure that the conversation history provides factual information, we use trusted sources from the Internet to ground the answer a<sup>i</sup> to each query qi . Since q<sup>i</sup> can be complicated, we first prompt the LLM to break down q<sup>i</sup> into a set of search queries (Figure [2](#page-3-2) 4 ) and the searched results will be evaluated using a rule-based filter according to

<span id="page-3-3"></span><sup>7</sup> <https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/>

the Wikipedia guideline[8](#page-4-2) to exclude untrustworthy sources (Figure [2](#page-3-2) 5 ). Finally, the LLM synthesizes the trustworthy sources to generate the answer ai , and these sources will also be added to R for full article generation ([§3.4\)](#page-4-1).

# <span id="page-4-0"></span>3.3 Creating the Article Outline

After thoroughly researching the topic through N + 1 simulated conversations, denoted as {C0, C1, ..., C<sup>N</sup> }, STORM creates an outline before the actual writing starts. To fully leverage the internal knowledge of LLMs, we first prompt the model to generate a draft outline O<sup>D</sup> given only the topic t (Figure [2](#page-3-2) 7 ). O<sup>D</sup> typically provides a general but organized framework. Subsequently, the LLM is prompted with the topic t, the draft outline OD, and the simulated conversations {C0, C1, ..., C<sup>N</sup> } to refine the outline (Figure [2](#page-3-2) 8 ). This results in an improved outline O which will be used for producing the full-length article.

# <span id="page-4-1"></span>3.4 Writing the Full-Length Article

Building upon the references R collected and the outline O developed during the pre-writing stage, the full-length article can be composed section by section. Since it is usually impossible to fit the entire R within the context window of the LLM, we use the section title and headings of its all-level subsections to retrieve relevant documents from R based on semantic similarity calculated from Sentence-BERT embeddings. With the relevant information at hand, the LLM is then prompted to generate the section with citations. Once all sections are generated, they are concatenated to form the full-length article. Since the sections are generated in parallel, we prompt the LLM with the concatenated article to delete repeated information to improve coherence. Furthermore, in alignment with Wikipedia's stylistic norms, the LLM is also utilized to synthesize a summary of the entire article, forming the lead section at the beginning.

# 4 Experiments

# 4.1 Article Selection

STORM is capable of researching complicated topics and writing long articles from detailed outlines. However, in this controlled experiment, we limit the final output to at most 4000 tokens (roughly 3000 words). For a meaningful comparison, we

randomly select 100 samples from the FreshWiki dataset (see [§2.1\)](#page-2-0) that have human-written articles not exceeding 3000 words.

# <span id="page-4-4"></span>4.2 Automatic Metrics

As discussed in [§2.2,](#page-2-7) we evaluate the outline quality to assess the pre-writing stage by calculating the *heading soft recall* and *heading entity recall*. A higher recall score signifies a more comprehensive outline relative to the human-written article.

To assess the full-length article quality, we adopt *ROUGE scores* [\(Lin,](#page-10-7) [2004\)](#page-10-7) and compute the *entity recall* in the article level based on FLAIR NER results. Moreover, based on Wikipedia criteria[9](#page-4-3) , we evaluate the article from the aspects of (1) *Interest Level*, (2) *Coherence and Organization*, (3) *Relevance and Focus*, (4) *Coverage*, and (5) *Verifiability*. For aspects (1)-(4), we use Prometheus [\(Kim](#page-10-8) [et al.,](#page-10-8) [2023\)](#page-10-8), a 13B evaluator LLM to score the article based on a 5-point rubric collaboratively developed with two experienced Wikipedia editors (see Appendix [C.2\)](#page-16-0). For verifiability, we calculate the *citation recall* and *citation precision* based on the definition in [Gao et al.](#page-9-11) [\(2023\)](#page-9-11). We use Mistral 7B-Instruct [\(Jiang et al.,](#page-9-12) [2023a\)](#page-9-12) to examine whether the cited passages entail the generated sentence.

# 4.3 Baselines

As prior works use different setups and do not use LLMs, they are hard to compare directly. Instead, we use the following three LLM-based baselines.

- 1. *Direct Gen*, a baseline that directly prompts the LLM to generate an outline, which is then used to generate the full-length article.
- 2. *RAG*, a retrieval-augmented generation baseline that searches with the topic and uses the searched results together with the topic t to generate an outline or the entire article.
- 3. *Outline-driven RAG (oRAG)*, which is identical to *RAG* in outline creation, but further searches additional information with section titles to generate the article section by section.

# 4.4 STORM Implementation

We build STORM with zero-shot prompting using the DSPy framework [\(Khattab et al.,](#page-10-9) [2023\)](#page-10-9). Appendix [B](#page-13-2) includes the pseudo code and corresponding prompts. The hyperparameters N and M

in STORM are both set as 5. We use the chat model gpt-3.5-turbo for question asking and use gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct for other parts of STORM. We also experiment with using gpt-4 for drafting and refining the outline (Figure [2](#page-3-2) 7 - 8 ). For reported results, the simulated topic expert in STORM is grounded on the You.com search API[10](#page-5-0) , although the proposed pipeline is compatible with other search engines. The ground truth Wikipedia article is excluded from the search results.

For final article generation, we only report the results using gpt-4 as gpt-3.5 is not faithful to sources when generating text with citations [\(Gao](#page-9-11) [et al.,](#page-9-11) [2023\)](#page-9-11). We set temperature as 1.0 and top\_p as 0.9 for all experiments.

# 5 Results and Analysis

#### <span id="page-5-3"></span>5.1 Main Results

We use outline coverage as a proxy to assess the prewriting stage (see [§2.2\)](#page-2-7). Table [3](#page-5-1) shows the heading soft recall and entity recall. Outlines directly generated by LLMs (*Direct Gen*) already demonstrate

high heading soft recall, indicating LLMs' ability to grasp high-level aspects of a topic through their rich parametric knowledge. However, STORM, by asking effective questions to research the topic, can create higher recall outlines that cover more topicspecific aspects. Notably, although *RAG* leverages additional information, presenting unorganized information in the context window makes outline generation more challenging for the weaker model, *i.e.*, GPT-3.5, leading to worse performance. To test the limit of the *RAG* baseline, we further expand the retrieved sources by starting with the outline produced by *RAG*, using its section titles as search queries to collect more sources, and inputting the newly collected sources together with the initial outline to LLM to generate a polished outline. This modified approach is referred to as "*RAG-expand*" in Table [3.](#page-5-1) The experiment results indicate that even though having an additional round of search and refinement can improve the outline produced by *RAG*, our proposed STORM still surpasses its performance.

We further evaluate the full-length article quality. As shown in Table [2,](#page-5-2) *oRAG* significantly outperforms *RAG*, highlighting the effectiveness of using outlines for structuring full-length article generation. Despite this method's advantages in leveraging retrieval and outlining, our approach still outperforms it. The effective question asking mechanism enhances the articles with greater entity recall. The evaluator LLM also rates these articles with significantly higher scores in the aspects of "Interest Level", "Relevance and Focus", and "Coverage". Nonetheless, we acknowledge the possibility of the evaluator LLM overrating machine-generated text. Our careful human evaluation ([§6\)](#page-6-0) reveals that STORM still has much room for improvement.

Although this work primarily focuses on the prewriting stage and does not optimize generating text with citations, we still examine the citation quality of articles produced by our approach. As reported

Appendix [C.3](#page-16-1) investigates the unsupported sentences and reveals that the primary issues stem from drawing improper inferences and inaccurate paraphrasing, rather than hallucinating non-existent contents.

#### 5.2 Ablation Studies

As introduced in [§3,](#page-2-8) STORM prompts LLMs to ask effective questions by discovering specific perspectives and simulating multi-turn conversations. We conduct the ablation study on outline creation by comparing STORM with two variants: (1) "STORM w/o Perspective", which omits perspective in the question generation prompt; (2) "STORM w/o Conversation", which prompts LLMs to generate a set number of questions altogether. To ensure a fair comparison, we control an equal total number of generated questions across all variants. Table [3](#page-5-1) shows the ablation results and full STORM pipeline produces outlines with the highest recall. Also, "STORM w/o Conversation" gives much worse results, indicating reading relevant information is crucial to generating effective questions. We further examine how many unique sources are collected in R via different variants. As shown in Table [5,](#page-6-2) the full pipeline discovers more different sources and the trend is in accord with the automatic metrics for outline quality.

We also verify whether having an outline stage is necessary with STORM. In Table [2,](#page-5-2) "STORM w/o Outline Stage" denotes the results of generating the entire article given the topic and the simulated conversations. Removing the outline stage significantly deteriorates the performance across all metrics.

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>6 Human Evaluation

To better understand the strengths and weaknesses of STORM, we conduct human evaluation by collaborating with 10 experienced Wikipedia editors

<span id="page-6-3"></span>

Table 6: Human evaluation results on 20 pairs of articles generated by STORM and *oRAG*. Each pair of articles is evaluated by two Wikipedia editors. The ratings are given on a scale between 1 and 7, with values ≥ 4 indicating good quality (see Table [10\)](#page-19-0). We conduct paired t-test and report the p-value.

who have made at least 500 edits on Wikipedia and have more than 1 year of experience. We randomly sample 20 topics from our dataset and evaluate the articles generated by our method and *oRAG*, the best baseline according to the automatic evaluation. Each pair of articles is assigned to 2 editors.

We request editors to judge each article from the same five aspects defined in [§4.2,](#page-4-4) but using a 1 to 7 scale for more fine-grained evaluation. While our automatic evaluation uses citation quality as a proxy to evaluate *Verifiability*, we stick to the Wikipedia standard of "verifiable with no original research" in human evaluation. Besides rating the articles, editors are asked to provide open-ended feedback and pairwise preference. After the evaluation finishes, they are further requested to compare an article produced by our method, which they have just reviewed, with its human-written counterpart, and report their perceived usefulness of STORM using a 1-5 Likert scale. More human evaluation details are included in Appendix [D.](#page-18-0) Table [6](#page-6-3) presents the rating and pairwise comparison results.[11](#page-6-4)

Articles produced by STORM exhibit greater breadth and depth than oRAG outputs. In accord with the finding in [§5.1,](#page-5-3) editors judge articles produced by STORM as more interesting, organized, and having broader coverage compared to *oRAG* outputs. Specifically, 25% more articles produced by STORM are considered organized (*Organization* rating ≥ 4), and 10% more are deemed to have good coverage (*Coverage* rating ≥ 4). Even in comparison with human-written articles, one editor praises our result as providing "a bit more

<span id="page-6-4"></span><sup>11</sup>For the 1-7 scale rating results on each criterion, we calculate the Krippendorff's Alpha to measure the inter annotator agreement (IAA), and the results are as follows: *Interest Level* (0.349), *Organization* (0.221), *Relevance* (0.256), *Coverage* (0.346), *Verifiability* (0.388).

background information" and another notes that "I found that the AI articles had more depth compared to the Wikipedia articles". STORM also outperforms the best baseline in pairwise comparison.

More information in |R| poses challenges beyond factual hallucination. We examine 14 pairwise comparison responses where editors prefer oRAG outputs over STORM. Excluding 3 cases where pairwise preferences do not align with their ratings, editors assign lower *Verifiability* scores to articles from our approach in over 50% of the cases. Through analyzing the articles and editors' freeform feedback, we discover that *low Verifiability scores stem from red herring fallacy or overspeculation issues*. These arise when the generated articles introduce unverifiable connections between different pieces of information in |R| or between the information and the topic (examples included in Table [11\)](#page-20-0). Compared to the widely discussed factual hallucination [\(Shuster et al.,](#page-11-10) [2021;](#page-11-10) [Huang](#page-9-13) [et al.,](#page-9-13) [2023\)](#page-9-13), addressing such verifiability issues is more nuanced, surpassing basic fact-checking [\(Min](#page-10-10) [et al.,](#page-10-10) [2023\)](#page-10-10).

Generated articles trail behind well-revised human works. While STORM outperforms the oRAG baseline, editors comment that the generated articles are *less informative than actual Wikipedia pages*. Another major issue identified is *the transfer of bias and tone from Internet sources to the generated article*, with 7 out of 10 editors mentioning that the STORM-generated articles sound "emotional" or "unneutral". More analysis is discussed in Appendix [E.](#page-18-1) This feedback suggests that reducing the retrieval bias in the pre-writing stage is a worthwhile direction for future work.

Generated articles are a good starting point. As shown in Figure [3,](#page-7-0) editors are unanimous in agreeing that STORM can aid them in their pre-writing stage. It is gratifying to know that the tool is helpful to experienced editors. 80% of the editors think that STORM can help them edit a Wikipedia article

for a new topic. More reservation is expressed to the usefulness of STORM for the Wikipedia community at large; nonetheless, 70% of the editors think it is useful, with only 10% disagreeing.

# 7 Related Works

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Augmenting language models (LMs) with retrieval at inference time is a typical way to leverage external knowledge stores [\(Ram et al.,](#page-11-11) [2023;](#page-11-11) [Izacard](#page-9-14) [et al.,](#page-9-14) [2023\)](#page-9-14). While some works use retrieval to construct demonstrations for in-context learning [\(Li et al.,](#page-10-11) [2023;](#page-10-11) [Liu et al.,](#page-10-12) [2022;](#page-10-12) [Agrawal et al.,](#page-9-15) [2023;](#page-9-15) [Poesia et al.,](#page-11-12) [2022;](#page-11-12) [Shi et al.,](#page-11-13) [2022;](#page-11-13) [Khattab](#page-10-13) [et al.,](#page-10-13) [2022\)](#page-10-13), another line of works uses retrieval to provide additional information for LMs to ground on. [Lewis et al.](#page-10-14) [\(2020\)](#page-10-14) study RAG on knowledgeintensive NLP tasks and find it improves diversity and factuality. [Semnani et al.](#page-11-14) [\(2023\)](#page-11-14) designs a RAG-based chatbot grounded on English Wikipedia to stop LLM-based chatbots from hallucination. Besides, RAG can be used to generate text with citations [\(Menick et al.,](#page-10-15) [2022;](#page-10-15) [Gao et al.,](#page-9-11) [2023\)](#page-9-11) and build attributed question answering systems [\(Bohnet et al.,](#page-9-16) [2023\)](#page-9-16). While RAG is widely studied in question answering, how to use it for long-form article generation is less investigated.

As a general framework, RAG is flexible in both the retrieval source and time. The retrieval sources can vary from domain databases [\(Zakka et al.,](#page-12-1) [2023\)](#page-12-1), code documentation [\(Zhou et al.,](#page-12-2) [2023\)](#page-12-2), to the whole Internet [\(Nakano et al.,](#page-10-16) [2022;](#page-10-16) [Komeili](#page-10-17) [et al.,](#page-10-17) [2022\)](#page-10-17). Regarding the time, besides a onetime retrieval before generation, the system can be designed to self-decide when to retrieve across the course of the generation [\(Jiang et al.,](#page-9-17) [2023b;](#page-9-17) [Parisi](#page-10-18) [et al.,](#page-10-18) [2022;](#page-10-18) [Shuster et al.,](#page-11-15) [2022;](#page-11-15) [Yao et al.,](#page-12-3) [2023\)](#page-12-3). Automatic Expository Writing Different from other types of long-form generation [\(Yang et al.,](#page-12-4) [2022;](#page-12-4) [Feng et al.,](#page-9-18) [2018\)](#page-9-18), automatic expository writing requires grounding on external documents and leveraging the interplay between reading and writing. [Balepur et al.](#page-9-1) [\(2023\)](#page-9-1) propose the Imitate-Retrieve-Paraphrase framework for expository writing at the paragraph level to address the challenges in synthesizing information from multiple sources. Beyond summarizing sources, [Shen et al.](#page-11-16) [\(2023\)](#page-11-16) highlight that expository writing requires the author's sensemaking process over source documents and good outline planning. We tackle these challenges by focusing on the pre-writing stage.

Question Asking in NLP Question asking capabilities in NLP systems have expanded across several fronts, including generating clarification questions to understand user intents [\(Aliannejadi et al.,](#page-9-19) [2019;](#page-9-19) [Rahmani et al.,](#page-11-17) [2023\)](#page-11-17), and breaking large questions into smaller ones to improve compositional reasoning [\(Press et al.,](#page-11-18) [2023\)](#page-11-18). While humans usually ask questions to learn new knowledge [\(Taw](#page-11-4)[fik et al.,](#page-11-4) [2020;](#page-11-4) [Booth et al.,](#page-9-5) [2003\)](#page-9-5), how to optimize question informativeness and specificity in information-seeking conversations remains less explored. The closest work is [Qi et al.](#page-11-19) [\(2020\)](#page-11-19) which defines the question informativeness using the unigram precision function and uses reinforcement learning to increase the question informativeness.

# 8 Conclusion

We propose STORM, an LLM-based writing system that automates the pre-writing stage for creating Wikipedia-like articles from scratch. We curate the FreshWiki dataset and establish evaluation criteria to study the generation of grounded longform articles. Experimental results demonstrate that the question asking mechanism in STORM improves both the outline and article quality. With the improved breadth and depth, STORM helps surface new challenges for grounded writing systems through expert evaluation. The experienced Wikipedia editors in our study unanimously agree that STORM is helpful for their pre-writing stage.

# Limitations

In this work, we explore generating Wikipedialike articles from scratch as a way to push the frontier of automatic expository writing and longform article generation. While our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in both automatic and human evaluations, the quality of machine-written articles still lags behind wellrevised human-authored articles, specifically in aspects of neutrality and verifiability. Although STORM discovers different perspectives in researching the given topic, the collected information may still be biased towards dominant sources on the Internet and may contain promotional content. Moreover, the verifiability issues identified in this work go beyond factual hallucination, which highlights new challenges to grounded writing systems.

Another limitation of this work is that although we focus on the task of generating Wikipedia-like articles from scratch, our task setup is still simplified to only consider the generation of free-form text. Human-authored high-quality Wikipedia articles usually contain structured data and multimodal information. We leave the exploration of generating multi-modal grounded articles for future work.

# Ethics Statement

Different from the creative generation, grounded article generation may impact how people learn about topics or consume source information. All the studies and the evaluation in this work are designed to prevent the dissemination of misinformation by not publishing generated content online and implementing strict accuracy checks. We avoid any disruption to Wikipedia or related communities, as our system does not interact with live pages. Also, although we try to generate grounded articles, we believe there is no privacy issue related to this work as we only use information publicly available on the Internet.

The primary risk of our work is that the Wikipedia articles written by our system are grounded on information on the Internet which contains some biased or discriminative content on its own. Currently, our system relies on the search engine to retrieve information but does not include any post-processing module. We believe improving the retrieval module to have good coverage of different viewpoints and adding a content sifting module to the current system will be a critical next step to achieve better neutrality and balance in the generated articles.

Another limitation we see from an ethical point of view is that we only consider writing English Wikipedia articles in this work. Extending the current system to a multilingual setup is a meaningful direction for future work as more topics do not have Wikipedia pages in non-English languages.

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>A Dataset Details

As discussed in [§2.1,](#page-2-0) we curate the FreshWiki dataset by collecting *recent* and *high-quality* English Wikipedia articles. We select the most-edited pages over a specific period rather than using creation dates as a cutoff because most of Wikipedia articles are "stubs" or are of low quality when they were created. For quality, we consider articles predicted to be of B-class quality or above. According to Wikipedia statistics[12](#page-13-3), only around 3% of existing Wikipedia pages meet this quality standard. As LLMs can generate reasonably good outputs, we think it is important to use high-quality humanwritten articles as references for further research.

For experiments in this work, we randomly select 100 samples with human-written articles under 3000 words to have a meaningful comparison. Table [7](#page-13-4) gives the data statistics. Notably, humanauthored articles have a large number of references but they require numerous edits to achieve this. Figure [4](#page-13-5) illustrates the evolution of the reference count in the article edit process and Figure [5](#page-13-6) gives the distribution of edit counts for human-authored articles used in our experiments.

# <span id="page-13-2"></span>B Pseudo Code of STORM

In [§3,](#page-2-8) we introduce STORM, a framework that automates the pre-writing stage by discovering different perspectives, simulating information-seeking conversations, and creating a comprehensive outline. Algorithm [1](#page-16-2) displays the skeleton of STORM.

We implement STORM with zero-shot prompting using the DSPy framework [\(Khattab et al.,](#page-10-9) [2023\)](#page-10-9). Listing [1](#page-14-0) and [2](#page-15-0) show the prompts used in our implementation. We highlight that STORM offers a general framework designed to assist the creation of grounded, long-form articles, without depending extensively on prompt engineering for a single domain.

# C Automatic Evaluation Details

#### <span id="page-13-1"></span>C.1 Soft Heading Recall

We calculate the soft heading recall between the multi-level headings in the generated outline, considered as the prediction P, and those in the humanwritten article, considered as the ground truth G. The calculation is based on the soft recall definition in [Fränti and Mariescu-Istodor](#page-9-8) [\(2023\)](#page-9-8). Given a set A = {Ai} K <sup>i</sup>=1, *soft count* of an item is defined as the inverse of the sum of its similarity to other items in the set:

<span id="page-13-7"></span>
$$\text{count}\left(A\_i\right) = \frac{1}{\sum\_{j=1}^{K} \text{Sim}\left(A\_i, A\_j\right)}\tag{1}$$

$$\text{Sim}\left(A\_i, A\_j\right) = \cos\left(\text{embed}(A\_i), \text{embed}(A\_j)\right),$$

of A is the sum of the counts of its individual items:

$$\text{card}(A) = \sum\_{i=1}^{K} \text{count}\left(A\_i\right) \tag{2}$$

The soft heading recall is calculated as

$$\text{soft reading } recall = \frac{\text{card}(G \cap P)}{\text{card}(G)}, \quad (3)$$

where the cardinality of intersection is defined via the union as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} \text{card}(G \cap P) &= \\ \text{card}(G) + \text{card}(P) - \text{card}(G \cup P) .\end{aligned} \qquad (4)$$

We use Prometheus[14](#page-16-3) [\(Kim et al.,](#page-10-8) [2023\)](#page-10-8), a 13B open-source evaluator LLM that can assess longform text based on customized 1-5 scale rubric, to grade the article from the aspects of *Interest level*, *Coherence and Organization*, *Relevance and Focus*, and *Coverage*. Table [8](#page-17-0) gives our grading rubric. While Prometheus is best used with a score 5 reference answer, we find adding the reference will exceed the context length limit of the model. Since [Kim et al.](#page-10-8) [\(2023\)](#page-10-8) show Prometheus ratings without reference also correlate well with human preferences, we omit the reference and trim the input article to be within 2000 words by iteratively removing contents from the shortest section to ensure the input can fit into the model's context window.

Table 9: Examples of different error types of unsupported sentences.

We use Mistral 7B-Instruct[15](#page-18-2) [\(Jiang et al.,](#page-9-12) [2023a\)](#page-9-12) to examine whether the cited passages entail the generated sentence. Table [4](#page-6-1) reports the citation quality of articles produced by our approach, showing that around 15% sentences in generated articles are unsupported by citations. We further investigate the failure cases by randomly sampling 10 articles and an author manually examines all the unsupported sentences in these articles. Besides sentences that are incorrectly split[16](#page-18-3), lack citations, or are deemed supported by the author's judgment, our analysis identifies three main error categories (examples are given in Table [9\)](#page-17-1): *improper inferential linking*, *inaccurate paraphrasing*, and *citing irrelevant sources*.

We show the error distribution in Figure [6.](#page-16-4) Notably, the most common errors stem from the tendency of LLMs to form improper inferential links between different pieces of information presented in the context window. Our analysis of citation quality suggests that, in addition to avoiding hallucinations, future research in grounded text generation should also focus on preventing LLMs from making overly inferential leaps based on the provided information.

# <span id="page-18-0"></span>D Human Evaluation Details

We recruited 10 experienced Wikipedia editors to participate in our study by creating a research page on Meta-Wiki[17](#page-18-4) and reaching out to active editors who have recently approved articles for Wikipedia.[18](#page-18-5) Our participation group includes 3 editors with 1-5 years of experience, 4 with 6-10 years, and 3 with over 15 years of contribution. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution and the participants signed the consent form through Qualtrics questionnaires before the study started.

To streamline the evaluation of grounded articles, we developed a web application, which features a side-by-side display of the article and its citation snippets, to gather ratings and open-ended feedback

for each article. Figure [7](#page-21-0) shows the screenshot of our web application and the full article produced by STORM is included in Table [12.](#page-22-0) For human evaluation, we use a 1 to 7 scale for more finegrained evaluation. The grading rubric is included in Table [10.](#page-19-0)

We collected the pairwise preferences and the perceived usefulness of STORM via an online questionnaire. Specifically, for the perceived usefulness, we request editors to rate their agreement with statements "I think it can be specifically helpful for my pre-writing stage (*e.g.*, collecting relevant sources, outlining, drafting).", "I think it will help me edit a Wikipedia article for a new topic", "I think it can be a potentially useful tool for the Wikipedia community" on a Likert scale of 1-5, corresponding to *Strongly disagree*, *Somewhat disagree*, *Neither agree nor disagree*, *Somewhat agree*, *Strongly agree*.

# <span id="page-18-1"></span>E Error Analysis

While articles produced by STORM are preferred by both automatic metrics and human evaluation, experienced editors still identified multiple problems with the machine-generated articles. We analyze the free-form comments and summarize the major issues in Table [11.](#page-20-0)

The primary issue raised is that the generated articles often contain emotional language and lack neutrality, primarily due to the source material. STORM currently retrieves grounding sources from the Internet which is not neutral and contains considerable promotional content on its own. Addressing this bias in the pre-writing stage represents a valuable direction for future research. Another major issue is the red herring fallacy or the over-association of unrelated facts. Addressing this challenge calls for high-level sensemaking rather than mere fact-level verification.

<span id="page-18-3"></span><sup>16</sup>Following [Gao et al.](#page-9-11) [\(2023\)](#page-9-11), we check citation quality in the sentence level and split articles into sentences using NLTK sent\_tokenize. sent\_tokenize sometimes fails to split sentences correctly when the article contains special words like "No.12847", "Bhatia et al.", *etc.*

<sup>18</sup>Since evaluating Wikipedia-like articles is timeconsuming and requires expertise, we paid each participant 50\$ for our study.

#### Interest Level

<span id="page-19-0"></span>1: Not engaging at all; no attempt to capture the reader's attention.

2: Slightly engaging with rare moments that capture attention.

3: Fairly engaging with a basic narrative but lacking depth.

4: Moderately engaging with several interesting points.

5: Quite engaging with a well-structured narrative and noteworthy points that frequently capture and retain attention.

6: Very engaging with a compelling narrative that captures and mostly retains attention.

7: Exceptionally engaging throughout, with a compelling narrative that consistently stimulates interest.

#### Coherence and Organization

1: Disorganized; lacks logical structure and coherence.

2: Poor organization; some structure is evident but very weak.

3: Fairly organized; a basic structure is present but not consistently followed.

4: Organized; a clear structure is mostly followed with some lapses in coherence.

5: Good organization; a clear structure with minor lapses in coherence.

6: Very well-organized; a logical structure with transitions that effectively guide the reader.

7: Excellently organized; the article is logically structured with seamless transitions and a clear argument.

#### Relevance and Focus

1: Off-topic; the content does not align with the headline or core subject.

2: Mostly off-topic with some relevant points.

3: Somewhat on topic but with several digressions; the core subject is evident but not consistently adhered to.

4: Generally on topic, despite a few unrelated details.

5: Mostly on topic and focused; the narrative has a consistent relevance to the core subject with infrequent digressions.

6: Highly relevant with a focused narrative and purpose.

7: Exceptionally focused and entirely on topic; the article is tightly centered on the subject, with every piece of information contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

#### Broad Coverage

1: Severely lacking; offers little to no coverage of the topic's primary aspects, resulting in a very narrow perspective.

2: Minimal coverage; addresses only a small selection of the topic's main aspects, with significant omissions.

3: Partial coverage; includes some of the topic's main aspects but misses others, resulting in an incomplete portrayal.

4: Acceptable breadth; covers most main aspects, though it may stray into minor unnecessary details or overlook some relevant points.

5: Good coverage; achieves broad coverage of the topic, hitting on all major points with minimal extraneous information.

6: Comprehensive; provides thorough coverage of all significant aspects of the topic, with a well-balanced focus.

7: Exemplary in breadth; delivers outstanding coverage, thoroughly detailing all crucial aspects of the topic without including irrelevant information.

#### Verifiability
